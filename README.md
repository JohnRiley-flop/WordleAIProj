AI Worle Bot

This project is the Wordle subsytem for my higher level AI, Americano. Cano for short.
It's purpose is to utilize AI to solve worldle puzzles in unique ways and give insight to clever guessing methods and strategies.

To run the project, run the wordle.py file and for the prompt asking how many games are to be played:
Enter a positive number for how many games you wish the AI to play.
Enter a negative number for the absolute value of how many games you, the person, would like the play.
